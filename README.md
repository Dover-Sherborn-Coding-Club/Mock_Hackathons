Here are all the mock hackathons we're going to be doing. Once you've finished the code for each one, post it in your own folder (called "your name") inside the proper hackathon folder. If you don't have code for our mock hackathons, just create your own folder and put one file in it with the link to your presentation/description.

Mock Hackathon 1:
Education and Convenience: Create a program that can help the average student. Your solution should try to solve  typical problems students have during their learning journey. The idea/program should make sure that it's easy for everyone to access and help people learn better. It's okay if your final program doesn't look the best.
P.S. I won't dock anything if a similar idea already exists. Just don't deliberately copy other projects or ideas.

Guiding Questions:
How can you improve the quality of online education?
What tools could help students better manage their study schedules and resources?
How can you make learning more engaging and interactive for students (especially of different ages)?

Rules:
1. You can use any module or library. I recommend you use APIs (if you don't know what that is, good it, or don't use any) to make a really good project. Only do that if you know how to use libraries.
2. Don't copy and paste any code from the internet
3. It's okay to use the internet as a reference

If you aren't coding this project, create a slideshow or a canva to present at next meeting. Make sure your idea can realistically be coded by someone of your skill level.
